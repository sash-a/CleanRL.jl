# CleanRL.jl
Simple single file implementations of Reinforcement Learning algorithms in Julia.  
Inspired by [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl)


## TODO (Algorithms):
* ~~Simple DQN~~
* ~~A2C~~
* Rainbow
* ~~PPO~~
* ~~DDPG~~
* SAC

## TODO (Utils):
* ~~General replay buffer~~
* ~~CLI for hyperparameters~~
* ~~Support loggers~~
* GPU training
* ~~Multi-thread PPO~~
* Vectorized envs
* ~~Plotting~~
* ~~Multi-loggers (file/console/Tensorboard)~~
* ~~Make nn inputs F32 - F32 env wrapper?~~ - done for PPO
* Make individual file runners e.g experiments/run_ppo.(jl/sh)
* Better logging - log interval and always log at correct step

## TODO (Investigate):
* Profile PPO
